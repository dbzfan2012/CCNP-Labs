Notes:

LSA Type 1:  Router LSA
LSA Type 2:  Network LSA
LSA Type 3:  Summary LSA
LSA Type 4:  Summary ASBR LSA
LSA Type 5:  Autonomous system external LSA
LSA Type 6:  Multicast OSPF LSA
LSA Type 7:  Not-so-stubby area LSA


LSA Type 1: These LSAs send out between routers within the same area and don't leave said area. 
These LSAs are used to describe the interface of a router and its neighbors which are in the same area.


LSA Type 2: These LSAs are generated by the Designated Router, or the DR. These LSAs go to all routers
connected to the multi-acess network, the DR, and the prefix and subnet mask.


LSA Type 3: These LSAs are generated by Area Border Routers, or ABR. They advertise inter-area router
information to other areas that the ABR is connected to. 


LSA Type 4: These LSAs advertise the presence of an Autonomous System Border Router, or ASBR, to
other areas. For example, when the R2 ABR receives an LSA type 1 from the R1 ASBR, it will create
an LSA type 4 packet, which advertises the ASBR route received from Area 1, and will put it into
Area 0. 

LSA Type 5: These LSAs are sent out by the ASBR and represent external routes another AS.
They contain metric and cost information, however, there is new info from external routes.
There is the E-bit, forwarding address, and route tag.

Type 6 LSA: These LSAs are used for multicast OSPF, but they are not important since
Cisco stopped supporting these LSAs.

Type 7 LSA: These LSAs are external LSAs, and they are only found in NSSA Areas (Not So Stubby Areas).
The NSSA border router translates these into type 5 LSAs for the rest of the OSPF network.

Stub Area - A stub area is an area in which you do not allow adertisements of external routes.
This helps reduce the size of the LSDB (Link State Data Base)

Not So Stubby Areas (NSSA) - Like stub areas, they prevent external advertisements into NSSAs.
NSSAs are more flexible than stub areas because they can import external routes into the OSPF
routing domain and thereby provide transit service to small routing domains that are not a part
of the OSPF routing domain.

Totally Stubby Areas - These stub areas prevent LSA type 3, type 4, and type 5 to be flooded
into the area. It replaces all these LSAs with a default route. It is basically a stub area, but
it also removes LSA type 3.
